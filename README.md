# Gamepad To Pro
###### Use the Wii U GamePad as Pro Controller in games

The plugin is not active on system apps.

To use, set channel (controller number) in the Aroma config menu (L + DPAD Down + Select) and toggle enable on.

If you're using this for multiplayer in **New Super Mario Bros. U, New Super Luigi U, or New Super Mario Bros. U + New Super Luigi U**, set the channel to the number of Wii U Pro Controllers/Wiimotes connected. 

For example, if you have 2 real Wiimotes and 1 real Wii U Pro Controller, set the channel to 3.
